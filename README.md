## Supporting Underprivileged Athletes

India possesses a lot of potential in the sports industry with bucket loads of success in cricket and hockey. However , they lack the proper talent for other fields like football , which is a growing concern for India. Many talented athletes come from poor economic backgrounds and are unable to make it to the national trials to show their worth. Your task is to create a virtual , affordable platform for these athletes to get financial backing and support to fulfill their full potential and make India proud on the big stage!
